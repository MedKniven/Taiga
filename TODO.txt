Wish-list:
- Drag and drop item handling
- Loading screen

TODO:
- Movement sprites (Running)
- Attacking sprites (Unarmed(jabbing/stabbing, can be used for knife), meleeweapon, pistol, rifle/big gun), 
  most can be two animation sprites, no idle sprite? Must display equiped weapon in UI then.
- Health system (UI update, get/set health,  armor calculation) 
- Persistent stats on saved game.
- Menu system...
- Dialogue system
- - Interaction dialogue (dialogue GO inherits from talkable inherits from interactable)

Pipeline:
- Map editing with bitmaps
- Movement (Running) [Just add a onButton and change bool isRunning, and change movespeed]

Working:
- Movement (Walking)
- Dynamic sprite change on animation event
- Camera control
- Item pickup
- Item equip
- Item use
- UI equipped inventory

Done:
